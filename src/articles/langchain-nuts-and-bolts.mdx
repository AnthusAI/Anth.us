Here are some examples of use-cases for LangChain for people who aren't afraid of code.

Here's a minimal example of an AI API request using LangChain.  This is so simple that it's almost a degenerate case:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
model = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o")
model.invoke("Is the Sagrada Família located in Barcelona?").content
```

Output:

```
Yes, the Sagrada Família is located in Barcelona, Spain. It is a famous basilica designed by the renowned architect Antoni Gaudí. Construction of the Sagrada Família began in 1882 and, although it remains unfinished, it is one of the most iconic landmarks in Barcelona and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
```
