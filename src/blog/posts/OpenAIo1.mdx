[OpenAI's o1](https://openai.com/o1/) is a new system that showcases advanced reasoning capabilities in large language models. It builds upon research in [learning to reason](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) and introduces [o1-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-reasoning/), a more cost-efficient version.

o1 provides further evidence that deconstructing complex tasks into simpler ones and addressing them through agentic workflows is the most effective way to achieve optimal results from a model. This approach aligns with established best practices in AI system design.

However, the cost implications of o1 are significant. The token cost for o1 is two orders of magnitude higher than traditional models, and it generates additional reasoning tokens. This positions o1 as a premium "get smarter" solution - an Easy Button for when you need an agentic workflow but lack the time or expertise to build a custom system.

While o1 offers valuable insights for improving AI performance, its high cost makes it less practical for widespread adoption. It serves best as a quick solution for complex reasoning tasks when efficiency is less critical than immediate results.

In the evolving landscape of AI tools, o1 represents a trade-off between advanced capabilities and cost-effectiveness, highlighting the ongoing challenge of balancing performance with resource efficiency in AI development.
