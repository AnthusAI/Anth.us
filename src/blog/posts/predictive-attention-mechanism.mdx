As a demonstration of an attention mechanism, researchers at Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands demonstrated a system that can reconstruct the images that a monkey saw from brain activity in [*PAM: Predictive Attention Mechanism for Neural Decoding of Visual Perception*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.04.596589v1).

The top row of images is what the monkey saw.

The bottom row of images were reconstructed by a deep neural network from monkey brain activity.

Lower loss values to the left.  The one on the far left looks nearly perfect.
